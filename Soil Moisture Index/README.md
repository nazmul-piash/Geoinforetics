## Soil Moisture Index

The Soil Water Index quantifies the moisture condition at various depths in the soil. It is mainly driven by the precipitation via the process of infiltration. Soil moisture is a very heterogeneous variable and varies on small scales with soil properties and drainage patterns.

The investigation period for the tasks is selected between the month's May to August of 2018. SMI map is generated on dates of 2018-05-16, 2018-06-16, 2018-07-16, 2018-08-16. Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) Climate Data Center (CDC) has free access to the climate data of the weather station which provides the precipitation data of the interested area. The free access to the climate data center allows using the historical and recent data for the precipitation
