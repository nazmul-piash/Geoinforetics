## Georeferencing
Georeferencing or georegistration is a type of coordinate transformation that binds a digital raster image or vector database that represents a geographic space to a spatial reference system, thus locating the digital data in the real world. It is thus the geographic form of image registration.

In the county of Olpe, a new industrial site with two buildings is being proposed. This area has been georeferenced and merged with NRW's Digital Ortophotos Web Mapping Services
(WMS). The geo-reference of two building roof regions has been shown

Soil and wather sample colcted for lab test from Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord and the position is marked menually with a map. with the Geo referencing tool the position ofthe samle location was collection.
By identifying the location from WMTS NW DOP, Georeferencing used to marge the map and find the Latitude, Longitude of the location and plot them with the marked loaction.
